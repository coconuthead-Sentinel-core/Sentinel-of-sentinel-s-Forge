# Sentinel Forge: Cognitive AI Orchestration Platform

> **Status:** Alpha v2.1 (Architecture Rebuilt) | **Pilot:** VR Studios

**Sentinel Forge** is an enterprise-grade **AI Orchestration Backend** designed to power intelligent, stateful applications. It combines:
- **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture:** Blending LLM creativity with structured logic.
- **Persistent Memory Lattice:** Cosmos DB + Vector Search for long-term recall.
- **Cognitive Pipelines:** Modular services for Chat, Memory, and System Health.

## 🎯 The "Platform" Concept
You are not just building a bot; you have built a **Cognitive Engine**.
- **The Engine:** Sentinel Forge (Backend, API, Database, Logic).
- **The Vehicle:** VR Studios (The first interface/use-case).

This architecture allows you to deploy VR Studios today, and a completely different application tomorrow, using the same brain.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities
1.  **Multi-Model Support:** Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) or Mock Mode for dev.
2.  **Repository Pattern:** Clean separation between logic and data (Cosmos DB).
3.  **Domain-Driven Design:** Pure Python models independent of infrastructure.
4.  **Observability:** Built-in metrics, dashboards, and health checks.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1.  **Configure:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2.  **Run:** `python scripts/run_full_eval.py` (Automated Pipeline).
3.  **Explore:** Open `docs/ROADMAP.md` to see the path to production.
