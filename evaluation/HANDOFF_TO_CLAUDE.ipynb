    "# 🚨 URGENT: Evaluation Pipeline Blocked - Need Your Help\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Blocker\n",
    "**File:** `backend/api.py`  \n",
    "**Line 1:** Has `REM filepath:` (batch syntax) instead of `# filepath:` (Python comment)  \n",
    "**Impact:** Can't import module → can't start server → entire eval pipeline stalled\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We've Built (Ready to Deploy)\n",
    "1. ✅ **Evaluation Metrics Defined**: Relevance, Coherence, Groundedness\n",
    "2. ✅ **Test Dataset Created**: `evaluation/test_queries.json` (10 queries)\n",
    "3. ✅ **Response Collector**: `evaluation/collect_responses.py` (ready to run)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Needed From You\n",
    "1. **Fix the syntax error** - User fears breaking code, needs gentle approach\n",
    "2. **Add missing imports** - `Depends, Body, Response, status, Request, logging` not imported\n",
    "3. **Run response collector** - Once fixed, execute to gather AI outputs\n",
    "4. **Generate eval code** - Use azure-ai-evaluation SDK with our 3 metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Context\n",
    "- Overwhelmed by incremental fixes\n",
    "- Wants AI-driven solutions (not manual editing)\n",
    "- Needs \"one-click\" approach to move forward\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Mission\n",
    "**Create automated fix script that:**\n",
    "- Replaces `REM` with `#` on line 1\n",
    "- Adds missing imports\n",
    "- Validates syntax\n",
    "- Provides single command to run\n",
    "\n",
    "User will trust a complete solution more than piecemeal instructions."

    "1. **Fix Strategy:** Script-based auto-fix or interactive repair tool?\n",
    "2. **Test Coverage:** 10 queries enough or expand to 50-100?\n",

    "4. **Delivery Format:** Jupyter notebook, CLI script, or VS Code task for final eval?\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Eval:** Worth evaluating both `/ai/chat` AND `/cog/process` separately?\n",
